    <h1><b>welcome to hall</b></h1>
    <p>a hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls.[1] In the Iron Age, a mead hall was such a simple building and was the <br />
    residence of a lord and his retainers. Later, rooms were partitioned from it, and the space next to the front door became the entrance hall. <br />
    Today, the (entrance) hall of a house is the space next to the front door or vestibule leading to the rooms directly and/or indirectly.<br />
     Where the hall inside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a passage, corridor <br />
    (from Spanish corredor used in El Escorial and 100 years later in Castle Howard) or hallway.</p>
