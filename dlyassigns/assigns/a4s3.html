    <p><b>Eagle  is a common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae; </br> 
    belongs to several groups of genera that are not necessarily closely <br />
     to each other.</b></p>
    <p>Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with a heavy head and beak. Even the smallest eagles, </br>
    like the booted eagle (Aquila pennata) (which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo)</br>
     or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis)), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct,</br>
    than any other raptors apart from some vultures. </p>
